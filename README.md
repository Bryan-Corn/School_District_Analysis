Software: Python v3.7.11, Anaconda v4.12.0, Pandas

## Deliverables

```
- A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format:
  • Total number of students
  • Total number of schools
  • Total budget
  • Average math score
  • Average reading score
  • Percentage of students who passed math
  • Percentage of students who passed reading
  • Overall passing percentage
```
```
- An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
- Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
  • Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  • The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school

  • School performance based on the budget per student
  • School performance based on the school size

  • Percentage of students passing math in the column "% Passing Math"
  • Overall passing percentage in the column "% Overall Passing"
  ```
  
# Results

  Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

How is the district summary affected?
How is the school summary affected?
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

```
  
```
- Create a new DataFrame for each school in the district
  • School name
  • School type
